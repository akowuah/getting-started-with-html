<h2>WHAT TO KEEP (from lectures)</h2>
    
<b>1 - What a Web Page is</b>
<br>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
   
   <br><br><b>2 - How Coding Works</b>
<br>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. 

   <br><br><b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b>
<br>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). 
For example, if you forget to close a (b) tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.

   <br><br><b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
<br>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up

   <br><br><b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
<br>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
   <ul>
<li><b>Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag <b>p</b> for example and a closing tag, <b>/p</b>. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <b>br</b> tag).
<li><b>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<li><b>Attribute:</b> This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write (a href="www.udacity.com")
   </ul>
   <h2>MY VERSION - MORE NOTES</h2>
   
<b>1.	The Web:</b>
<br>A collection of HTML docs. Glued together by links.
Major players are: You, Internet, Web Servers.  Traffic is transferred using a protocol called HTTP.  You make request through browser to retrieve files from servers.
   
<br><br><b>2.	HTML:</b>
<br>The heart of the web; Made up of:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp- txt content
<br>&nbsp&nbsp- markup (plain text is plain text in html.  To let plain text look different, you need to use markup)
<br>&nbsp&nbsp- references to other documents
<br>&nbsp&nbsp- links to other pages
   
<br><br><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2a. Markup</b>
<br>Consists of elements. Elements are made up of opening and closing tags and the substance in between them.
   <p><b>&nbsp&nbspTags:</b></p>
 <ul>
   <li><b>b</b> tag: it bolds
   <li><b>strong</b> tag: similar to bold
   <li><b>em</b> tag: it italicizes
   <li><b>form</b> tag: creates form for user input
 </ul>  
   
<br><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2b. HTML Attributes (tag attr = “value”) contents (/tag)</b> 
  <ul>
<li><b>Anchor tag:</b>  Used for making links (a href=www.reddit.com) derp  (/a)
<li><b>Image tag:</b> Used for referencing images (img src= “url” alt = “text”) 
  <br>NOTE: Image tags have no closing tags. It’s called a void tag (i.e. no closing tag).
  </ul>
<br>Another tag without a closing tag is <b>br</b>.  The break tag is used to move content to the next line.
The (p)(/p>) tag also moves content to another line.  It defines paragraphs (a block, not just an inline).  The <b>p</b> tag is NOT a void tag.

<br><br><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2c. Container tags</b> 
 <ul>
   <li><b>Span tag: (span) (/span)</b>; span is a block tag (creates a block or space around the element.
   <li><b>Div tag: (div) (/div)</b>; div is an inline tag (does not create a block around the element)
 </ul>
